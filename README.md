## My process

### Built with

HTML
Vanilla CSS - trying to get a better understanding of the basics, you see...

### What I learned
Used my new found knowledge of HTML5 semantics, CSS Selectors and Box Model positioning to conquer this project. Now that I have gained a somewhat firm grasp in these concepts (still gotta long way to go haha), completing this challenge was a breeze in the park compared to the last challenge. Instead of searching up any issues that I had, I would go to the html and css references to check the purposes of each tag and to check each attribute associated with a particular property that I wanted to use. I also began tinkering around with the Chrome Developer tools to see which styles took precedence over which and it is there I learnt that if you have stylings for the same element then the stylign that is further down takes precedence! Interesting, no wonder its called cascading sheets (i think so?) I also discovered this really neat thing called the 'Computed styles' which allowed me to see what attributes the elements were taking. Up until now, I never really valued the Chrome Devtools but I see now that its an indispensible tool! I also used Pesticide, a chrome extension that allows you to see the website in boxes, and it proved to be another invaluable tool.

In conclusion, I think I enjoyed this challenge more than the first one because I knew what I was doing from the fresh knowledge that I had about CSS selectors and the box model. This just goes to show how important it is to have a strong foundation in HTML and CSS basics if you aim to become a successful front-end developer. I'm still learning obviously but my learning journey has become a lot more enjoyable ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

### Continued development

Will deffo do more challenges from frontend mentor! 
Will also look at other solutions to study how others have done it!

DISCLAIMER: the desktop size works well but it just goes 'kaput' when it comes to the mobile version. That's deffo an area of improvement!
